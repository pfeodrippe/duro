** TODO benchmark comparison with c++ verilator
** TODO better error handling
** TODO add default make/gcc options
** TODO handle ariane alu input (packed struct)
** TODO build zen talk

* Problems
** struct
Types are not outputted by the verilog -> xml converter, need to
check reftype. Hun, maybe the types are sequential to the struct,
have to check this.

#+BEGIN_SRC xml
<structdtype fl="e476" id="6" name="ariane_pkg::xxx">
  <memberdtype fl="e477" id="198" name="jj" sub_dtype_id="7"/>
</structdtype>
<refdtype fl="e477" id="199" name="omg" sub_dtype_id="7"/>
#+END_SRC

The memberdtype are followed by its types after structdtype, it
allows to find the respective type of a member.


* Zen Talk
** Hardware programming
** Verilator
** JNR
** XML
** VCD
** Cache
